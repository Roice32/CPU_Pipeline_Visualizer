Have consistent `const`s.

Clock Synchronization

Ignore invalid opcodes in DE, signal them to EX, let EX decide what to do with them based on IP.

Find a way to make LoggablePackage be reasonable...

IC *may* sometimes deliver the jumped-to FW because of incremental run, but then behavior is undefined
	- this slipping may occur randomly. no idea rn how to fix

dump logs to file

	SYNCHRONIZATION ANALYSIS:

LS: Working as intended: [t, t+14], final operations do not surpass 1 tick.
IC: Working as intended: [t, t+2], no issues with LS.
DE: Seems to be working as intende: [t, t+1], properly timed between IC and EX.
EX: Seems to be working as intended: [t, t+4], no sync loss on final ops, goes idle & awakes ok on calls to LS.
